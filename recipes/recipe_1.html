    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Stick-to-your-ribs pasta recipes seem like fall and winter meals, right? Sure, pasta salad knows no season. But come spring, we love main-dish recipes that amp up the flavors of hearty greens like spinach, peas, and asparagus—and fresh produce in general—while letting actual pasta take a bit of a back seat. These recipes do just that. They may even put a bit of, ahem, spring in your step.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>

        <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk honey, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken in hot oil until lightly brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
